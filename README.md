This is a starter kit for the first lab of the Software Engineering Course.

This project consisted of improving the existing code and completing it with the missing functions, working as a team and being assigned to each member a specific task.
The main goal of this mini-assignment was teamwork, so that everyone could use Git in the development of the application.
